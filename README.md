# HSI-PP is a stand-alone, automated, and open-source hyperspectral image processing platform adapted to various applications in plant phenotyping to serve the plant research community. HSI-PP integrates advanced image processing procedures and can extract meaningful information from different kinds of hyperspectral images and, therefore, improves the decision-making process. In addition, HSI-PP is able to prepare the hyperspectral images for deep-learning analysis and train the machine learning model for classification and regression.
